# Mamba-Accelerated-for-Medical-Video-Classification
*A deep learning-based approach using Mamba for efficient medical video classification.*  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Mamba** model for **medical video classification**, leveraging **state-space models (SSMs)** to improve efficiency over traditional deep learning models. The system classifies **medical instructional and non-instructional videos**, optimizing speed and memory usage compared to **BigBird**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Medical Video Classification** – Differentiates instructional vs. non-instructional medical content.  
✅ **Mamba Model Implementation** – Optimized for efficient sequence modeling.  
✅ **Dataset Processing** – Downloads, trims, and resizes videos for training.  
✅ **Multi-Model Benchmarking** – Compares Mamba against **BigBird**.  

## 📊 Dataset  
This project uses **medical instructional and non-instructional videos** from the `MedVidCL` dataset.  
- **Categories:**  
  ✅ **Medical Instructional** – Demonstrations & procedures  
  ✅ **Medical Non-instructional** – General medical discussions  
  ✅ **Non-medical** – Irrelevant content  

📌 **Preprocessing Steps:**  
1️⃣ **Download videos**  
2️⃣ **Trim the middle 30 seconds & resize to 128x128**  
3️⃣ **Extract frames & normalize**
